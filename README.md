🔍 What It Does:

Takes in employee details like age, job role, distance from office, monthly income, and more.

Uses machine learning models (like XGBoost, Random Forest, and LightGBM) to predict if an employee might quit.

Displays results visually using charts and reports.

💡 Why It’s Useful:

Helps HR teams identify employees who may be at risk of leaving.

Allows companies to take early action to improve employee satisfaction and reduce turnover.

🛠️ How It Works:

The app loads and analyzes real HR data.

It trains multiple machine learning models to find the best one.

Users can filter data by job roles and see visual insights.

The model predicts attrition for all employees and saves results.

You can download predictions and performance reports.
